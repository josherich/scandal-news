## About

I've worked in this industry for five years and came across many moments that I feel disappointed. People have much bigger tolerance on things I see noxious and illegal. I've seen CEOs talk about trading user data, abusing disgraceful designs, having no ideas or just ignore privacy. Tons of these ignorance and abuse are going on right now, because the expense of doing so, or the chance of being caught and punished is so small.

Here comes the intention of this project:

1. build a database.

2. build a good design on search and discovery.
